# 👗 Snap2Style – Wardrobe

## ✨ Why Snap2Style?

Shopping for clothes based on an image is still harder than it should be. Most people:

- See a stylish look online but don’t know where to find similar items.
- Waste time browsing hundreds of products manually.
- Want suggestions tailored to their preferences, not generic trends.

**Snap2Style** solves this using client-side AI and a seamless user experience.
